    "- **Simulations** are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomenas from the real world, used for specific purposes\n",
    "    - Purposes include drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world \n",
    "- Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon\n",
    "- Often, when developing an abstract simulation, it is neccessary to remove specific deatils or simplify aspects.       \n",
    "    - Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded\n",
    "- Simulations allow the formulation and redinement of hypotheses under consideration\n",
    "- Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators\n",
