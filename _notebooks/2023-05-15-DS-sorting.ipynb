    "1. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues to iterate through the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. To sort the given list [75, 17, 46, 80, 67, 45, 69, 79, 40, 0] using Bubble Sort, we start by comparing the first two elements, swapping them if necessary. We continue this process until we reach the end of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Selection Sort is another simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. The algorithm repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part, thus expanding the sorted part by one element. To sort the given list [75, 17, 46, 80, 67, 45, 69, 79, 40, 0] using Selection Sort, we start by finding the minimum element in the entire list and swap it with the first element. Then, we find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted part and swap it with the second element. \n",

    "How would you sort this list with... \n",
    "- Merge Sort\n",
    "- Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts a list by recursively dividing it into smaller sublists, sorting them, and then merging them back together. To sort the given list [88, 39, 53, 39, 58, 43, 74, 81, 71, 51] using Merge Sort, we would first split the list into two halves, then recursively apply Merge Sort on each half. This process continues until we reach the base case of having single-element sublists. Then, we merge the sublists back together by comparing and inserting the elements in the correct order. The merging step combines the sorted sublists to produce a sorted final list. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by dividing the list into a sorted and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part contains only the first element of the list, and the unsorted part contains the rest. The algorithm then iterates through the unsorted part, taking one element at a time and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part. To sort the given list [88, 39, 53, 39, 58, 43, 74, 81, 71, 51] using Insertion Sort, we would start with the second element (39) and compare it with the elements in the sorted part. If an element in the sorted part is greater than the current element, we shift it to the right. This process continues until we find the correct position for the current element, and we insert it there.\n",
